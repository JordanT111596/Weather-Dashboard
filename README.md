Homework 6 by Jordan Triplett
Completed 08/14/2020

This assignment has us create a weather dashboard that grabs information from the OpenWeatherAPI and displays it on the screen based on a user city search.

As specified in the assignment, when searching for a city, one is  presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is also added to the search history. When viewing current weather conditions for that city, one is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. The UV Index is color coded based on favorable, moderate, or severe conditions. When viewing future weather conditions, one is presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity. When clicking on a city from the search history, that is locally stored in the browser, one is again presented with current and future conditions for that city. When opening the weather dashboard again, one is presented with the last searched city forecast. Now go see what the weather is where you live!
